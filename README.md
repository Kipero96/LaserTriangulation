# LaserTriangulation
Laser-based triangulation project used for creating 3D point clouds. A lot of improvements to be made in future e.g. on-line working, AI object recognition etc.


Libraries used:

OpenCV 4.5.2
PCL 1.11#

Please swap point_cloud.h file in your repository with this one -> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/master/common/include/pcl/point_cloud.h
in order to skip errors related with variables mapping.
